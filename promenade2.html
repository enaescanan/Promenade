        <h1> how do i play? </h1>
        <p> print out your doll and use it as your piece on the board (tip: tape it to a toothpick then stick that toothpick onto a small paper cube to get it to stay upright).</p> 
               
        <p>get the cards, board, and die ready. determine the order of turns. </p>
        
        <p> roll the die to start off the game. </p>
        
        <p> each player gets one turn, and can move in any direction per turn.</p> 
        
        <p> if you land on a place without a number, you end your turn on that space. </p>
        
        <p> if you land on a place with a number, pick the card that corresponds to that number. each card will have a “truth” half and a “dare” half, and you will have to accomplish one to keep moving. </p>
        
        <p> doing your “truth” or “dare” right will let you move forward the amount of spaces noted on the card. doing it wrong will force you to move back the amount of spaces noted on the card. whether or not you do it right depends on your friends. your friends can also determine which direction you move in going backwards (you get to choose going forwards).</p>
        
        <p> you can repeat cards. on your second round with a card, do the option that you did not previously do. if you have already done both the “truth” or the “dare,” you can do either one again. </p>
        
        <p> the first to reach the center (#27) and get crowned prom royalty wins. the game ends when someone wins.</p>

            <h1> i played the game, and i have some questions.</h1>

            <input type="checkbox" id="faq1"> 
            <h2> <label for="faq1">why is gender important? why do we care?</label> </h2>
            <p> some people don’t think about their gender much, while for other people it’s one of the biggest parts of their identity.<br /> <br /> some people consider gender a “social construct,” and thus essentially “unreal.” other people consider their gender a core part of who they are because it affects a lot of how they experience their daily life. gender is thus especially “real” to them, because it has consequences. transgender and gender-variant people, whose gender identity does not match what they were assigned based on biological sex, tend to consider gender very “real” because they have to fight for their own gender to be respected. <br /> <br />  while you don’t personally have to care about gender, it’s good to be respectful and sympathetic to those who do.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faqsection">   
            <input type="checkbox" id="faq2"> 
            <h2><label for="faq2">aren’t gender and sex the same?</label></h2>
            <p> not necessarily! biological sex is about being categorized as “male” or “female” as a member of the human species based on your genitals and reproductive characteristics. gender is about how you perceive yourself, how you want others to see you, and how you express yourself. <br /> <br /> the cultural standard assumes that your gender expression and identity (masculine man/feminine woman) matches your biological sex (male/female), but that is not true for everyone. in the end, it all depends on the person.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faqsection">   
            <input type="checkbox" id="faq3"> 
            <h2><label for="faq3">if i’m not straight, does that change my gender? </label></h2>
            <p> not necessarily! some people attracted to the same gender adopt a non-standard gender expression or have a non-binary or transgender gender identity, but it’s not automatic that attraction to the same gender changes how you present yourself or how you identify. <br /> <br /> historically and culturally, attraction to others has been considered a factor in gender expression. for example, people have tended to believe that a gay man’s gayness compromises his masculinity somehow, and makes him more of a woman. while there are indeed plenty of people in the philippines who are technically biologically “gay men” but express and refer to themselves as women, there are also gay men who are firmly masculine, and there are gay men who express femininely but still identify as men. <br /> <br /> as always, it depends on the individual. the best thing to do is not compare too much how you experience your own gender and sexuality to how others do.</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="faqsection">   
            <input type="checkbox" id="faq4"> 
            <h2><label for="faq4">if i like girly things but am a boy, does that change my gender? </label></h2>
            <p> not necessarily! your gender expression may be different from what is considered “typical” for your gender identity, but it does not control or determine your gender identity per se. your identity as a boy is not lessened or invalidated by liking “girly” things. <br /> <br /> think of it this way: your gender expression is the unique way you present yourself and your identity. it makes your gender your own, more than what is dictated by cultural norms. together, gender identity + gender expression = your gender.</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="faqsection">   
            <input type="checkbox" id="faq5"> 
            <h2><label for="faq5">what happens when i don’t feel like either a boy or a girl, or what i feel like keeps changing? </label></h2>
            <p> that’s fine! gender isn’t confined to one of the two options (man or woman) we are usually given, and gender identity doesn’t have to be static. it’s normal to feel the way you do; there are lots of people who experience a non-binary gender identity now that we have the words to talk about it. <br /> <br /> you might want to check out the resources on gender and the lgbt community linked below and read about other people who aren’t strictly men or women. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faqsection">   
            <input type="checkbox" id="faq6"> 
            <h2><label for="faq6">how come it’s like there are so many genders nowadays? are these new genders real? </label></h2>
            <p> lately, more and more people have been considering their gender something they can personally discover and label as they wish. instead of understanding gender as a social category based on biological sex, many people tend to think of gender as something they experience as individuals. <br /> <br /> these new genders are as real as they are to the person who experiences them (in other words, real enough). however, they may not have weight as social categories. <br /> <br /> since these genders are indeed new, we don’t have any social framework for them yet, and in fact we might never have one. people’s new, non-binary genders may not yet have any bearing on what those people are expected to do or be in the social world the way the genders “man” and “woman” do.</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="faqsection">   
            <input type="checkbox" id="faq7"> 
            <h2><label for="faq7">do i have to label my gender? how do i find out what label is right for me? </label></h2>
            <p> you don’t have to label your gender, but it’s ok if you want to. you might decide to use a general label that doesn’t describe your gender in detail, or you might decide to look for a label that is more specific, including your mode of expression. <br /> <br /> if you want to label your gender, you can read articles or watch videos by gender-variant individuals and see what terms they use, or look up resources about gender (there are some linked below). <br /> <br /> if you don’t want to label your gender, you can just… not! you can experience and express your gender without strictly naming what it is or describing in detail what it means to you.</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="faqsection">   
            <input type="checkbox" id="faq8"> 
            <h2><label for="faq8">what if i just don’t understand how or agree that you could “feel” differently than what your body is?</label></h2>
            <p> even if you don’t understand it or agree with it, it’s not your duty or right  to tell gender-variant and transgender people they are incomprehensible to you or wrong. keep these thoughts to yourself when you are around them as basic courtesy, and listen to what they tell you about themselves. </p>
